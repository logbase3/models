A set of powerful and easy to use tools for data analysis.

Models is a set of powerful and easy to use tools for data analysis, data mining and machine learning. The project is just starting but I hope to start having contributions from other developers when I start to have stable versions of the software.


Online documentation is available on [GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/logbase3/models).
